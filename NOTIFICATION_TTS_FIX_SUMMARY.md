## 🧪 Testing Features Added

### Debug Panel
Added a debug panel in the dashboard with two test buttons:

1. **"Test Now"** - Immediately triggers a test notification with TTS
2. **"Test 30s"** - Schedules a test notification to fire in 30 seconds

## 📱 How to Test

### Step 1: Grant Permissions
When you first launch the app, it will automatically request all necessary permissions:
- Notification permissions (Android 13+)
- Audio settings permissions
- Exact alarm permissions (Android 12+)

### Step 2: Test Immediate Notification
1. Open the app and go to the dashboard
2. Scroll down to find the "🔧 Debug & Test" section
3. Tap "Test Now" button
4. You should see a notification and hear TTS speech immediately

### Step 3: Test Scheduled Notification  
1. Tap "Test 30s" button
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. You should receive a scheduled notification with TTS

### Step 4: Test Real Task Reminders
1. Add a task with a time close to current time (1-2 minutes ahead)
2. Wait for the scheduled time
3. Verify notification and TTS work

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Logs
All components now have comprehensive logging. Use Android Studio Logcat and filter by these tags:
- `MainActivity` - Permission requests and app lifecycle
- `PermissionManager` - Permission status and requests
- `TaskReminderReceiver` - Notification triggering
- `TTSService` - Text-to-speech operations
- `ReminderManager` - Alarm scheduling
- `HomeViewModel` - Task operations
- `BootReceiver` - Device reboot handling

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Notifications Not Showing
1. Check if notifications are enabled: Look for "NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED" in logs
2. Check permission status using debug panel
3. Verify notification channel creation in logs

#### TTS Not Working
1. Check TTS initialization in logs: Look for "TTS onInit" messages
2. Verify language setting: Should fallback to English if Hindi not available
3. Check TTS service lifecycle: Look for start/stop messages

#### Alarms Not Triggering
1. Check exact alarm permission: Look for "canScheduleExactAlarms" in logs
2. Verify time parsing: Check "Parsing time string" logs
3. Check if device is in doze mode (test with screen on first)

### Manual Permission Check
If automatic permission request fails, manually grant permissions:

1. **Notifications**: Settings → Apps → HealthForge → Notifications → Enable
2. **Alarms**: Settings → Apps → HealthForge → Special permissions → Alarms & reminders → Enable  
3. **Battery**: Settings → Battery → Battery optimization → HealthForge → Don't optimize

## 📋 Key Files Modified

1. **PermissionManager.kt** - New comprehensive permission handler
2. **MainActivity.kt** - Added permission requests on app start
3. **AndroidManifest.xml** - Added all required permissions
4. **TTSService.kt** - Complete rewrite with proper service handling
5. **TaskReminderReceiver.kt** - Enhanced with logging and error handling
6. **ReminderManager.kt** - Fixed alarm scheduling and time parsing
7. **HomeViewModel.kt** - Added context passing and proper reminder scheduling
8. **BootReceiver.kt** - Enhanced with Hilt injection and proper task rescheduling
9. **DashboardScreen.kt** - Added debug panel and fixed context passing

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

After implementing these fixes:

1. ✅ App will request all necessary permissions on first launch
2. ✅ Notifications will show with proper icons, sound, and vibration
3. ✅ TTS will speak task reminders in Hindi (fallback to English)
4. ✅ Task reminders will trigger at scheduled times
5. ✅ All operations will be logged for debugging
6. ✅ Tasks will be rescheduled after device reboot
7. ✅ Debug panel allows immediate testing

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Test on real device**: Emulators may not properly handle notifications and TTS
- **Battery optimization**: Some devices may need battery optimization disabled
- **Doze mode**: Android 6+ devices may delay notifications when in deep sleep
- **Language support**: TTS requires Hindi language pack installed, will fallback to English
- **Exact alarms**: Android 12+ requires explicit user permission for exact alarm scheduling

The implementation now includes comprehensive error handling, logging, and fallbacks to ensure reliable operation across different Android versions and device configurations.
